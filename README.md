# GITHUB REPO CLONE

## This was initially a job application but i decided to build it out for myself to play around and test my skills.

I will be building this out in three ways :

1. Vanilla HTML and JS
2. HTML and EJS with Node and Express
3. With React and styled components.

## Vanilla HTML AND JS V1

As of this first commit i do not have a way to help users create their own auth tokens, i will figure it out tho, believe that.

Okay so the initial commit is going to come without an api key, i mean it wasn't going to have one anyways but i cannot get "require" or "import" to work and i can't be bothered to use an extra script file for a module.

Also the first commit is not responsive

## Vite

Discovered vite and figured out how to import.

Make sure you run npm install in your terminal and create your "env.js" file with your api key.
